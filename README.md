# BL-RAW
Powerpoint and Python Notebook detailing the RAW file format used in Breakthrough Listen Observations.


The RAW file format is the highest time resolution data product available during an observation. These files are large (on the order of many GB). As such, RAW files are generally compressed and reduced to produce the more familiar Filterbank files. However, RAW files can provide rich information about an observation.

This repository explains, in-depth, the RAW file format. The PDF is a Powerpoint with a lot of information. The Python notebook is a quick tutorial showing how to use a RAW file.
